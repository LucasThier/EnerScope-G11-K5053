# Considerations & expectations

A running log of decisions, assumptions and things future work should keep in
mind. **Read this before making changes, and append to it when you introduce
something non-obvious.** Keep entries concise, dated, and human-readable.

Format: `- YYYY-MM-DD — <note>` (newest at the bottom of each section).

## Current expectations

- The `User` model is intentionally minimal: `mail`, `firstName`, `lastName`,
  `passwordHash` (plus `BaseEntity` audit fields). There are **no roles,
  permissions, or phone number** yet. The seeded `admin@enerscope.org` is a
  plain user; if admin privileges become real, add a role/flag **with** a
  migration, updated `docs/domain-model.md`, and tests.
- Authentication is **stateless** (JWT). There is no session table; a `Session`
  is rebuilt from the token on each request. Revocation before expiry is not
  supported — keep access-token lifetimes short.
- Flyway owns the schema; Hibernate runs in `validate`. The H2 profile used by
  tests disables Flyway and lets Hibernate build the schema — keep entities
  portable enough for both, or adjust the test profile deliberately.
- The frontend is a minimal shell on purpose: it must build and run, plus the
  API/session layer and types. Tailwind only; no hand-written CSS.

## Log

- 2026-07-03 — Initial scaffold: backend (auth/users/sessions/JWT/health),
  minimal frontend, docs, Docker, Flyway migration, admin seeder, tests.
- 2026-07-03 — Logging goes through the `AppLogger` interface; console output is
  the default (`ConsoleAppLogger`). Levels are configurable via `.env`
  (`LOG_LEVEL_APP`, `LOG_LEVEL_ROOT`).
- 2026-07-03 — Surefire loads Mockito as an explicit `-javaagent` (future JDKs
  disallow self-attaching); `maven-dependency-plugin` exposes the jar path.
- 2026-07-10 — Bulk user registration: `POST /users/bulk` (multipart `file`)
  parses a CSV, generates a strong password per row (`PasswordGenerator`,
  `SecureRandom`) and returns a `mail,password` CSV (`credentialsCsv`) plus a
  per-row failure list. Plaintext passwords are returned **once** in the
  response and never persisted; whoever calls the endpoint is responsible for
  distributing them securely. The endpoint is under `/users/**`, so it is
  **authenticated** (no `/auth` permitAll) — but there are still **no roles**,
  so *any* logged-in user can bulk-create accounts. When roles land, gate this
  behind an admin role. CSV parsing/writing uses a small in-repo helper
  (`common/CsvUtil`) instead of a new dependency; input is read fully into
  memory (fine for expected list sizes, bounded by Spring's multipart limits).
- 2026-07-10 — Backend packages reorganised **by feature, then by layer**.
  Feature packages with several classes now split into `controller`, `service`,
  `repository`, `model`, `filter`, `dto` subpackages (`user`, `auth`,
  `session`); the shared top-level `dto/` package was removed and each feature
  owns its DTOs (`user/dto`, `auth/dto`). The former `dto/session/*` records are
  now `auth/dto` (they belong to the auth endpoints). Single-class / infra
  packages (`jwt`, `health`, `money`, `seed`, `logging`, `util`, `common`,
  `config`) stay flat to avoid needless nesting. Convention documented in
  `AGENTS.md`; add new classes to the matching layer subpackage of their
  feature.
- 2026-07-10 — Added `AuthControllerTest` (`@WebMvcTest` + real
  `SecurityConfig`/`AuthFilter`, mocked services) covering register/login/
  refresh/logout, including validation (`400`), domain errors (`400`) and
  refresh failures (`401`). Test suite is now 44 cases. Introduced
  [`docs/testing.md`](testing.md) as a **test catalog** (class, type, per-case
  "what it verifies") and made keeping it in sync a Definition-of-done item in
  `AGENTS.md` — update it in the same change as any test add/remove/rename.
- 2026-08-22 — SCRUM-35 (ABM de Organización): added `organization/{model,
  repository,service,controller,dto}` following the `user`/`auth` layering,
  with `V3__create_organization_tables.sql` (`V2` is already taken twice by
  `V2__create_all_tables.sql`/`V2__create_nodes.sql`, so new migrations start
  at `V3`). Modeling decisions:
  - `OrganizationMember` is a join **entity** between `Organization` and
    `User` (not a direct `@ManyToMany`) because membership needs its own
    roles/permissions.
  - `OrganizationMemberRole` belongs to exactly one `OrganizationMember` (not
    a shared role catalog) — each membership owns its own role instance(s),
    per the provided class/ER diagrams.
  - The "add member" endpoint (`POST /organizations/{id}/members`) takes only
    `userId` + `memberType` (enum `OWNER`/`MEMBER`). The role's `name` and
    `permissions` are derived server-side from a fixed
    `memberType → permissions` map in `OrganizationService`
    (`OWNER` → `MANAGE_ORGANIZATION` + `VIEW_ORGANIZATION`, `MEMBER` →
    `VIEW_ORGANIZATION` only). There is **no API yet** to define a custom role
    name or a custom permission set — if that's needed later, extend
    `AddOrganizationMemberRequestDTO` instead of hardcoding more types.
  - `OrganizationMemberType` (`OWNER`, `MEMBER`) and
    `OrganizationMemberPermission` (`MANAGE_ORGANIZATION`,
    `VIEW_ORGANIZATION`) are intentionally minimal — the class diagram didn't
    pin concrete values, so these were chosen as the smallest set covering the
    ticket's scope. Extend them (with a migration, since permissions are
    persisted as strings) if a future ticket needs finer-grained roles.
  - Creating an organization does **not** auto-add the creator as a member —
    the ticket lists "create organization" and "add user" as separate steps,
    so that's how they're implemented. Revisit if product wants the creator
    to become `OWNER` automatically.
  - `Project` only has `name`/`description`/`organization` for this ticket —
    `members`/`versions` from the class diagram belong to a later
    ticket/module and were deliberately left out.
  - `(organization_id, user_id)` has a DB-level unique constraint (and a
    matching `@UniqueConstraint` on the entity) in addition to the
    application-level `existsByOrganizationIdAndUserId` check, mirroring how
    `app_user.mail` enforces uniqueness at both levels.
  - `gen_random_uuid()` (used by `id DEFAULT` on every new table) needs no
    extension: it's a PostgreSQL core builtin since v13, and
    `docker-compose.yml` pins `postgres:16-alpine`. Same as the pre-existing
    `V1`/`V2` migrations, which already rely on it without a `CREATE
    EXTENSION`.
